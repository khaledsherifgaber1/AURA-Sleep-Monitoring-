# 🌙 AURA – Sleep Monitoring Using GenAI

Welcome to **AURA**, a data science project focused on monitoring and analyzing sleep patterns using machine learning and generative AI techniques. This notebook demonstrates a full pipeline including preprocessing, visual exploration, and classification using the KNN algorithm.


## 🧠 Project Goals

- Monitor and analyze sleep behavior using machine learning.
- Visualize key patterns in the dataset using EDA techniques.
- Build and optimize a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier.
- Prepare the foundation for a GenAI-enhanced sleep assistant.


## 🔍 Features Explored

- Histogram, Pie Chart, Line Chart, Heatmap, Box Plot, Violin Plot, Pair Plot
- Outlier detection and feature scaling
- Feature-target splitting and train/test division
- KNN Classification with hyperparameter tuning


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- KNN Classifier
- StandardScaler
- GridSearchCV (for tuning)
